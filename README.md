# Java Basics - Collections

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will use java arrays and collections to solve a series of problems. You will use provided unit 
tests to verify that your solutions are correct.

There is one set of required exercises in this project. You will find the exercises in the 
`src/main/java/org/example/CollectionExercises.java` file.

There is also an optional set of challenges that involve creating a simple student manager. You will find the
`StudentManager` class in the `src/main/java/org/example` folder.

## Collection Exercises (Required)

You will find the collection exercises in the `src/main/java/org/example/CollectionExercises.java` file.

Each method in this class is a collection exercise. You will need to implement the method to solve the problem
described in the comments within the method.

Once you have completed the exercises, run the tests in the `src/test/java/org/example/CollectionExercisesTests.java`
file to verify that your solutions are correct.

To run these tests, right-click on the `CollectionExercisesTests` class and select `Run 'CollectionExercisesTests'`.

You will see the results of the tests in the `Run` tab at the bottom of the IDE.

## StudentManager Challenges (Optional)

A class named `StudentManger` is included in this project to show a larger example of collections applied to a "real"
program. The `StudentManager` class is a simple program that allows the user to manage a list of students. The program
allows the user to add students, remove students, and display the list of students.

The main menu is implemented in this class, but the methods that perform the actions are not implemented. You will need
to follow the comments in the `StudentManager` class to implement the methods.

Once you have implemented the methods, you can run the `Main` class to test the program. The `Main` class is located in
the `src/main/java/org/example` folder.  There are no unit tests for this class, as it involves input and output, so you
will need to test it manually.
